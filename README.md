##What's missing:
* Introduce Navigator pattern to navigate between Activities
* ADD UI tests
* Check if it is possible to abstract the android VM implementation from the Activities that use VMs.
* View model binding between the presenter and the view, so the view observes for changes coming from the presenter
* Better gradle structure
* A presentation layer between `domain` and `app` modules
* Kotlin  (⌐■_■)
